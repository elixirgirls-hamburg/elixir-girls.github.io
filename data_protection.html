However, we have to point out that if you make these changes, you may only be able to use our website/s with certain limitations. Cookies do not install or start any programs or other applications on your computer.</p><p>The deployment of cookies is based on the weighting of interests. It is in our interest to make visits to our website/s user friendly.</p><p><strong>3.5 Analysis Services for Websites, Tracking</strong></p><p><strong>Matomo</strong></p><p>We use the web analysis tool "Matomo" on our website. This tool is installed on our own servers.</p><p>If you send a "Do Not Track Header (DNT)" via your browser, this will be taken into account for most browsers and no tracking will be done.</p><p>The legal basis for "tracking" is Article 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR. Website analysis is in our legitimate interest and is used for the statistical collection of site usage for the continuous improvement of our website and the offer of our services.</p><p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p><p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p><p>Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous user profiles of the processed data can be created.</p><p>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p><p>The IP address submitted by the user's browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to its use of the online offer as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: http: // tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</p><p>For more information about Google's data usage, recruitment and opt-out options, please visit Google's websites:</p><ul><li>Data usage by Google when you use websites or apps of our partners: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners</a></li><li>Use of data for promotional purposes: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads" href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads</a></li><li>Manage information that Google uses to show you advertising: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/settings/ads</a></li><li>Determine what Google advertising shows you: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a></li></ul><p><strong>Google Re/Marketing Services</strong></p><p>We use the marketing and remarketing services ("Google Marketing Services") of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p><p>Google's marketing services allow us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted manner to show users only ads that potentially match their interests. For example, if users see ads for products they are interested in on other websites, they are referred to as "remarketing. For these purposes, when you visit our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, Google directly executes a Google code and incorporates it into the website's so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web beacons"). With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user's device (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com and googleadservices.com. In this file it is noted which websites the user visits, which contents he is interested in and which offers he has clicked, furthermore technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time as well as further information about the use of the online offer. The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby we inform within the scope of Google Analytics that the IP address within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area is shortened and only in exceptional cases completely transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address is not merged with user data within other Google services. The above information may also be linked to such information from other sources. If the user subsequently visits other websites, advertisements tailored to the user's interests may be displayed.</p><p>User data is processed pseudonymously within the framework of Google Marketing Services. This means, for example, that Google does not store and process the name or e-mail address of the user, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that, from Google's point of view, the ads are not administered and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who this cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymisation. The information DoubleClick collects about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.</p><p>One of the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program "Google AdWords". In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different "conversion cookie". Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected through the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers know the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, you will not receive any information that personally identifies users.</p><p>Another Google marketing service we use is the "Google Tag Manager", which can be used to integrate other Google analysis and marketing services into our website (e.g. "AdWords", "DoubleClick" or "Google Analytics").</p><p>Further information on the use of data by Google for marketing purposes can be found on the overview page: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads" href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads</a> , Google's data protection declaration can be found at <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy" href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a> .</p><p>If you wish to object to the collection of data by Google marketing services, you can use the setting and opt-out options provided by Google: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a></p><p>The use of the Google services mentioned takes place on the basis of a weighing of interests. We are interested in targeting our advertising campaigns to make our websites known to a wider audience. The legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 Letter f) DSGVO.</p><p><strong>Facebook Remarketing</strong></p><p>Within our online offer, so-called "Facebook pixels" of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you are resident in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"), are used. Using the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our offer as a target group for the display of ads, so-called "Facebook ads". Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads we have placed only to those Facebook users who have shown interest in our website. This means that with the help of the Facebook pixel we want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and do not appear annoying. The Facebook pixel also enables us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing if users were directed to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad.</p><p>The Facebook pixel is integrated directly by Facebook when our web pages are accessed and can store a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook when logged in, the visit to our offer is noted in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us and does not give us any information about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible. Facebook processes the data in accordance with Facebook's data usage guidelines. Accordingly, you will receive further information on how the remarketing pixel works and on the presentation of Facebook ads in general in Facebook's data usage policy: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/policy" href="https://www.facebook.com/policy" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/policy</a></p><p>You may opt out of Facebook pixel collection and use of your information to display Facebook ads. To do this, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions on the settings for usage-based advertising there: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a> or the opposition via the US website <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU website <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> explain. The settings are platform-independent, i.e. they are applied to all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.</p><p>The use of Facebook remarketing is based on a weighing of interests. Our interest is the target-group-specific playout of our advertising campaigns in order to make our websites known to a wider audience. The legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 Letter f) DSGVO.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn Conversion Tracking</strong></p><p>We use the analysis and conversion tracking technology of the LinkedIn platform on our website. The provider is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. This LinkedIn technology allows you to view more relevant advertising based on your interests.</p><p>Conversion cookies" are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. F) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest is the analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both our website and our advertising.</p><p>In addition, LinkedIn provides us with aggregated and anonymous reports of advertising activity and information on how you interact with our website. For more information about LinkedIn's privacy practices, please visit: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig</a>.</p><p>You may opt-out of LinkedIn's analysis of your usage patterns and display of interest-based recommendations by clicking the "Opt-out" button (for LinkedIn members) or the "Opt-out" button (for other users) at the following link: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out</a>.</p><p><strong>4. The Purposes of Processing Personal Data</strong></p><p>We process the aforementioned data to operate our website/s and to fulfill our contractual obligations vis-à-vis our customers and/or to protect our legitimate interests.</p><p>When we process inquiries outside of an active client/supplier relationship, we process data for sales and advertising purposes. You have the option to object to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time.</p><p><strong>5. Plugins of social networks (Social Plugins)</strong></p><p>On our website plugins of the following social networks are integrated: Facebook, Twitter, XING and LinkedIn.</p><p>The legal basis for the use of social plugins is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest and purpose in using social network plug-ins is to make our offer known to a broad public. The social networks are responsible for handling the data of their users in accordance with data protection regulations.</p><p><strong>5.1 Facebook Social Plugins</strong></p><p>Our online offer uses social plugins ("Plugins") of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). The plugins can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on a blue tile, the terms "like", "like" or a "thumbs up" sign) or by the addition "Facebook Social Plugin". The list and appearance of the Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a></p><p>When a user calls a function of this online service that contains such a plugin, his device establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly from Facebook to the user's device and integrated into the online service by the user. User profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the extent of the data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform the user according to our state of knowledge.</p><p>By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has called up the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. When users interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the Like button or commenting, the corresponding information is transferred directly from your device to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, it is still possible for Facebook to find out his IP address and save it. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.</p><p>The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as the relevant rights and setting options to protect the privacy of users can be found in Facebook's data protection information: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a></p><p>If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect information about him or her via this online service and link it to his or her Facebook member data, he or she must log out of Facebook and delete cookies before using our online service. Further settings and objections to the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings: <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a> or via the US-American website <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU website <a class='data-protection-link' data-cke-saved-href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> The settings are platform-independent, i.e. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.</p><p><strong>5.2 Twitter</strong></p><p>You can also share our content on the social network Twitter, Twitter Inc, 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.</p><p>When you click on the "Re-Tweet" button, the websites you visit are linked to your Twitter account and made known to other users.
